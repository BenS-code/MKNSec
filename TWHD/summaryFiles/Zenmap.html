    <h1>Zenmap - Comprehensive Overview</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Zenmap is a powerful and open-source network scanning tool that is an
      integral part of the Nmap (Network Mapper) suite. Designed to provide a
      user-friendly interface to Nmap, Zenmap facilitates the discovery,
      analysis, and documentation of network vulnerabilities. It is widely used
      by security professionals, network administrators, and penetration testers
      to assess the security posture of computer networks.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features of Zenmap</h2>
    <p>
      Zenmap incorporates several key features that make it an effective tool
      for network scanning and reconnaissance:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</strong> Zenmap offers a
        graphical interface that simplifies the process of creating and
        executing Nmap scans. This is especially beneficial for users who prefer
        a visual representation of scan results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Profile Saving:</strong> Users can save scan configurations as
        profiles, allowing for easy reuse of specific scan settings for
        different targets or scenarios.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Topography Mapping:</strong> Zenmap generates visual network
        maps, providing an overview of the target network's topology, including
        interconnected devices and their relationships.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Host Interaction:</strong> The tool enables users to interact
        with discovered hosts, exploring details such as open ports, services,
        and operating system information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scripting Engine:</strong> Zenmap allows users to leverage Nmap
        scripts for advanced scanning and vulnerability detection. This
        scripting engine enhances the tool's capabilities for in-depth network
        analysis.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Search and Filter:</strong> Users can search and filter scan
        results based on specific criteria, streamlining the process of
        identifying relevant information within large datasets.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Common Use Cases of Zenmap</h2>
    <p>
