      <section>
        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>
          A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and a
          destination server. It forwards requests from the client to the server
          and returns the server's response to the client, thereby hiding the
          client's IP address.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          When a client sends a request to access a web resource, it first
          connects to the proxy server instead of directly contacting the
          destination server. The proxy server then forwards the request to the
          destination server on behalf of the client.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Install and Configure</h2>
        <p>
          To install a proxy server, you can use software such as Squid Proxy
          Server or Nginx. Configuration involves specifying the proxy server's
          IP address and port number in the client's network settings.

      <section>
        <h2>How to Use</h2>
        <p>
          To use a proxy server, configure your client's network settings to
          specify the proxy server's IP address and port number. Alternatively,
          you can use proxychains, a tool that allows applications to connect to
          the internet through a proxy server.
