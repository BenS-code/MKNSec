        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>
          A Virtual Private Network (VPN) extends a private network across a
          public network, such as the internet. It enables users to send and
          receive data securely over a shared or public network as if their
          computing devices were directly connected to the private network.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          A VPN creates a secure tunnel between the user's device and the VPN
          server. All data traffic sent over this tunnel is encrypted, ensuring
          privacy and confidentiality. VPN chains involve routing data through
          multiple VPN servers to further enhance anonymity.

        <h2>How to Install and Configure</h2>
        <p>
          To use a VPN, you typically need to subscribe to a VPN service and
          install their software or configure built-in VPN settings on your
          device. Configuration involves specifying the VPN server's address,
          authentication credentials, and encryption settings.

        <h2>How to Use</h2>
        <p>
          Once installed and configured, you can connect to the VPN server using
          the provided client software or device settings. Once connected, all
          internet traffic will be routed through the VPN server, providing
          security and privacy.
