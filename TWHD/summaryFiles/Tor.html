        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>
          The Onion Router (Tor) is a free and open-source software that enables
          anonymous communication by directing internet traffic through a
          worldwide volunteer network consisting of thousands of relays to
          conceal a user's location and usage from anyone conducting network
          surveillance or traffic analysis.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Tor works by encrypting data multiple times and routing it through a
          series of relays, also known as nodes, before reaching its
          destination. Each relay decrypts a layer of encryption to reveal the
          next relay in the circuit. This process ensures that no single relay
          knows both the source and destination of the data, enhancing
          anonymity.

        <h2>How to Install and Configure</h2>
        <p>
          To use Tor, you can download and install the Tor Browser Bundle, which
          includes a modified version of the Firefox browser configured to use
          Tor. Alternatively, you can configure other web browsers to use the
          Tor network by specifying the Tor proxy settings.

        <h2>How to Use</h2>
        <p>
          Once installed, simply launch the Tor Browser and start browsing. Tor
          will automatically route your internet traffic through the Tor
          network, providing anonymity and privacy. It's essential to understand
          that while Tor enhances privacy, it may not guarantee complete
          anonymity and may be subject to certain risks.
