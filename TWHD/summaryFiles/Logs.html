    <h1>Logs for Forensic Analysis in Linux</h1>

    <p>
      In Linux systems, various logs are essential for forensic analysis as they
      contain valuable information about system activities, user actions, and
      potential security incidents.
    </p>

    <h2>Syslog</h2>
    <p>
      Syslog is a standard logging facility that collects messages from various
      system components and applications. It's typically stored in
      <code>/var/log/syslog</code> or <code>/var/log/messages</code>. Syslog
      provides insights into system events, such as startup/shutdown times,
      kernel messages, and application activities.
    </p>

    <h2>Auth.log</h2>
    <p>
      <code>Auth.log</code> (usually found in <code>/var/log/auth.log</code>)
      records authentication-related events, including login attempts,
      authentication failures, and user privilege escalation. It's crucial for
      tracking unauthorized access attempts and potential security breaches.
    </p>

    <h2>Secure.log</h2>
    <p>
      Similar to <code>auth.log</code>, <code>secure.log</code> (often located
      at <code>/var/log/secure</code>) logs authentication and
      authorization-related events, focusing on system security. It contains
      information about authentication attempts, password changes, and
      user/group modifications.
    </p>

    <h2>Kernel Logs</h2>
    <p>
      Kernel logs, accessible through <code>dmesg</code> command output or
      <code>/var/log/kern.log</code>, provide details about kernel-level
      activities, hardware events, and driver issues. Analyzing kernel logs can
      help identify hardware failures, system crashes, and potential security
      vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <h2>Audit.log</h2>
    <p>
      The Linux Audit Framework logs system-wide security events, including file
      access, user/group modifications, and privilege changes. The audit log is
      typically stored in <code>/var/log/audit/audit.log</code> and is crucial
      for monitoring and investigating security-related incidents.
    </p>

    <h2>Apache/Nginx Access and Error Logs</h2>
    <p>
      Web server logs, such as Apache's <code>access.log</code> and
      <code>error.log</code>, or Nginx's <code>access.log</code> and
      <code>error.log</code>, record HTTP requests, server responses, and
      errors. Analyzing web server logs can help detect suspicious activities,
      such as unauthorized access attempts or web application attacks.
    </p>

    <h2>SSH Logs</h2>
    <p>
      Logs related to SSH (Secure Shell) connections, such as
      <code>auth.log</code> or <code>secure.log</code>, document SSH login
      attempts, session starts/ends, and authentication failures. Monitoring SSH
      logs is essential for detecting unauthorized access attempts and potential
      security breaches.
    </p>

    <h2>Application Logs</h2>
    <p>
      Various applications generate logs containing valuable information about
      their activities, errors, and security events. These logs, typically
      stored in <code>/var/log</code> or application-specific directories, can
      provide insights into application behavior and potential security issues.
    </p>

    <h2>Sysdig/Falco Logs</h2>
    <p>
      Sysdig and Falco are container monitoring tools that capture system calls,
      network activities, and container events. Analyzing Sysdig/Falco logs can
      help detect abnormal behavior, intrusions, and security policy violations
      within containerized environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Database Logs</h2>
    <p>
      Database servers like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB generate logs
      containing queries, transactions, and errors. Analyzing database logs can
      reveal unauthorized access attempts, data manipulation attempts, and
      potential security breaches.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are some of the key logs used for forensic analysis in Linux
      systems. Depending on the system configuration and installed applications,
      additional logs may also be relevant for forensic investigations.
